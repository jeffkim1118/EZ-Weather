Ez Weather app

I made a simple weather app that allows people to search up weather by city names. I used a weather API called OpenWeatherMap API to provide accurate weather data as possible.
Before trying out this web app, please make sure that you put your own API key. Otherwise it won't work.

The users only need to type in city names around the world to search up data like the city's
temperature, windspeed, and weather condition. Also, it provides recommendation for each weather conditions.
It also creates a clear button to clear out the previous search data.
